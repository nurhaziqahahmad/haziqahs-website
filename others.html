<marquee><h2>MY REFLECTION: DESIGN CHOICES & CHALLENGES</h2></marquee>
<h3><font align="justify"><ul type="disc"><li>First and foremost, the design that I chose is inspired by a website from Nafisah Amran and Iman Abdul Rahim. Then, I loved all those cute things on their websites, so I applied it but with my own design that was simpler and cuter. Other than that, the chosen design, color, banner, logo, and font text describe me in real life, which is sweet, nice, cute, and simple. My hope is I want when people visit my website, they can literally know about my personality without any judging. Therefore, I design the cutest as I can for my website.</li></ul></h3>
<h3><font align="justify"><ul type="disc"><li>When it comes to designing a website from scratch, it was totally not easy, and I faced a lot of challenges during setting up the website, but my two common mistakes are during setting coding for the table and link: </li></ul></h3>
<h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>I always forgot to put the close tag such as </td> and </table>. Other than that, I always mistakenly wrote the coding in notepad because I was confused and forgot the position of the coding since there was too much other coding. For example, I always make mistakes when I want to use tables. I usually misplaced the content, it should be between <td></td> but I usually wrote besides <tr>.</li>
<br>
<br>
<li>As someone who easily to feel distracted, I always have problem when setting up all the hyperlink especially internal link since I need to use 2 coding which is <a href=” #”> </a> and <a name=””> </a>. My problem is I always forgot to put the hashtag and always changed these two coding, so the output will never be same as what I have planned before. Thus, usually I spend almost 1 hour in the hyperlink section.</li>

<marquee><h2>LESSON LEARNT</h2></marquee>
<h3><ol type="I" align="left">
<li>Write down the start tag and close tag first before the content.</li>
<li>Always use "break" tag to avoid any confusion.</li>
<li>The output will never be the same 100% as what has been planned.</li>
<li>Be patient because the first try will never be right, and it forced me to try again until I get what I want.</li>
<li>Design a website by using the plain editor was super hard and it made my energy drained but it still fun.</li>
